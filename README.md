ðŸš€ Kubernetes Failure Prediction using AI/ML

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to predict failures in Kubernetes clusters using advanced AI/ML techniques. By analyzing system logs and performance metrics, we build a highly optimized LightGBM model to detect potential failures such as:

âœ… Pod crashes
âœ… Resource bottlenecks
âœ… Network failures

This model enables proactive issue resolution, reducing downtime and improving cluster reliability.
